Infer the location query from the provided text and find the airport(s) highly relevant to the location query.

If there are multiple airport results, order the results from most to least relevant; if one result is far more relevant than the rest and is a near-perfect match to the location query, return only that result. Otherwise, return the ordered list of results, limiting to no more than ten results.
